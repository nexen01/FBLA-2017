Hello! Welcome to my Library Management System!
Made by: Mark Klinchin (Lower Moreland High School)

Requirements:
-Java 8 or higher should be installed
-JAR files should be associated with Java

To use this program, press the buttons to do as what they are told. **Make sure both a loaner and a product are selected before pressing any button.** A loaner is someone who can loan books (either student, teacher, or other loaner). A product is a broad term for either book, movie, or other form of media this library could offer. 

See the hard code to ensure that requirements were met. Here is a list of properties that are hardcoded which cannot be altered, but are there as values or pieces of code in the program:
 - A teahcer can issue books for twice as long as a student
 - a book can be issued three times as long as other media, and movies twice as long as other media (excluding books)
 - Each product has a different ID. For products with ISBN numbers, the first digit is a 1, the next 13 are the ISBN number, and the last 2 are sequencial starting from 01 in the order they are added to the library program. For products without ISBN numbers, the first digit is a 2, the next 13 are sequencial from 00 in the order they are added to the library program, and the last 2 are sequencial starting from 01 in the order they are added to the library program. Products cannot be added in this version of the program, however later versions will have a button that prompts the user to fill in the information to do this. 

Thank you for reviewing this program and taking time to read this brief informational guide about my program.
